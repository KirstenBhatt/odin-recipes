Project #1 Foundations 

This is my first project with The Odin Projects. Here I will be displaying my newly learned knowledge of git, github, html, amd the commandline. 

I have learned a lot about git and github and the commandline. The transition from the gui method to the commandline has been a bit difficult to grasp as i have spent a lot of my career relying on the visual icon to guide me to the folder itself. 

I have an appreciation for the commandline now, once I worked through the flash cards and really committed them to memory. 

As for git and github, I really enjoy the community of github. I will admit, as I am doing this project, I am only just now starting to get a grasp on git and it's purpose. Putting it into action on two seperate virtual machines created a learning curve and because of that, I now can struture my directory to be able to easily navigated in order to take on the repositories from git hub.
