        <div>
             <p class="center">Arroz Con Pollo is a dish that tastes like home to me. Growing up, this dish 
                was cooked pretty frequently. This dish is simple and 
                 delicious and a recipe that was handed to my sister and me
                 when we left our parent's house for the first time. This was 
                 probably one of the first things my sister and I cooked 
                for ourselves living independently for the first time.
                I would say that this is a family recipe but it's truly not,
                It is the recipe on the back of the Fiesta Spanish Rice 
                Spice shaker, this does not make it any less delicious.</p>
            <p class="center">With food comes language, in spanish, arroz tranlates 
                to rice and pollo tranlates to spanish. This dish being 
                chicken and rice, simple and delicious.</p>
